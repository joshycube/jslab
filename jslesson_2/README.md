## Lesson 2 - data structures and loops III/I

### Let's revise

- var, let, const
- Typescript, Flow
- Window object (in browsers e.g Chrome) - V8 engine
- Global in NodeJS (globalThis)
- We are going to dig deeper and deeper

### Programming principles

- Solution to real business problems
- There are always multiple ways of solving a problems
- Find the "bronze" not the gold - no pre optimization
- Make it readable - the next engineer will know your name and address :)

### Simple structures and loops (array, object, for loops)

We are using JSON structures instead of an SQL DB for the sole purpose of learning loopss

```
const genre = ['science fiction', 'fiction', 'drama', 'fantasy'];

function listByGenre(genre: string) {}
```
